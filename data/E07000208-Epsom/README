Dear Ms Geary
 
I write in reply to your recent Freedom of Information request; please find Epsom & Ewell Borough Councilâ€™s response below:
 
Both the Polling Stations and Polling Districts GIS data are now published on data.gov.uk and can be downloaded from there as GIS data.  
Links will be added within the next few days so that the data can be downloaded as CSV files and links to the relevant pages on our website.
 
The links to the datasets on data.gov are:
