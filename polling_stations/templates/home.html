<h2>Preview of Polling Station Finder</h2>
<p>This is a very early preview of the <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk">
    Democracy Club</a> Polling Station Finder</p>
<p>It's far from ready for use, however you can see an example of where we're
    hoping to be by typing in a postcode below:</p>

<form method=post>
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type=submit>Search</button>
</form>

<p>Some example searches to show a range of data quality:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://localhost:8000/council/E08000026/">Coventry City Council</a> (no data)</li>
    <li><a href="http://localhost:8000/council/E06000037/">West Berkshire Council</a> (Polling stations, no polling districts)</li>
    <li><a href="http://localhost:8000/council/E07000106/">Canterbury City Council</a> (Polling districts, no polling stations )</li>
</ul>
