        This file had several data quality problems:

        01. Code QSV2 appeared twice with 2 polling stations:
            'Quedgeley Community Centre' and 'Meadowside School'
        02. Missing stations for districts 'QFC4' and 'B4'

        Joe queried with council and received reply:
        > The polling station for QSV2 is Meadowside Schol
        > The polling station for QFC4 is Quedgeley Community Centre
        > and for B4 itâ€™s St. Lawrence Church Centre.
