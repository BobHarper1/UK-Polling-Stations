# UK-Polling-Stations

This is a work in progress project that needs help in a number of ways:

1. If you are in a Council, or related to one in some way, can you get us either of the following types of data:
    1. Polling station addresses for 2015
    2. Polling district shapefiles per polling district
2. If you are a developer (python, django, frontend, etc) or designer, we need help making the site itself.
3. If you are interested in helping us gather this data, or if you know a lot about the strange world of the UK geographic system.

If you are interested in helping out in any way at all, please contact sym@democracyclub.org.uk
